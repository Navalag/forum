        Community Rules
    </h6>
    <p>UNIT community is a community of developers who come together to share ideas and help each other succeed.</p>
    <p>
        We invite you to join in, but do have a few rules. The rules and values below exist to help you understand what it means to be a member of the community and cover all aspects of community interaction. We’re committed to upholding them, and we hope you will be too.
    </p>
    <dl class="dl-layout-01">
        <dt>We believe when the community succeeds, we succeed.</dt>
        <dd>
            We love healthy competition, but feel we’re all better off when we’re sharing ideas, knowledge and skills and helping one another. We come to give back, not shamelessly self-promote.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            We’re a community of many types of people.
        </dt>
        <dd>
            We are from different regions and a glorious melting pot of creative fields, skill levels, cultures, religions and more. We think the opportunity for anyone to achieve success no matter where they come from leads to a more meritocratic and equal world.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            We celebrate individuality and embrace diversity.
        </dt>
        <dd>
            We encourage different viewpoints as long as they’re presented in a way that’s constructive and respectful. Personal attacks as well as any behavior that is hateful or offensive based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender or sexual orientation are not okay.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            We’re excited about and inspired by collaboration.
        </dt>
        <dd>
            By collaborating with people from different backgrounds, we are exposed to new ideas and perspectives that fuel the creative process and innovation.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            We’re always learning because we’re hungry and curious.
        </dt>
        <dd>
            We’re all students and teachers. Our world moves super fast and we stay ahead of the pack by pushing and pulling each other forward. We don’t follow the trends, we make them.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h6 class="tt-title">We follow a few hard rules. Please DON’T:</h6>
